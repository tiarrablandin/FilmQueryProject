# FilmQueryProject

## Description
This application allows the user to search through a database of films using the films ID or a keyword search. Upon running a menu is displayed where the user must choose a selection for which search method they choose to use or exit the program.

## Technologies Used
Java, SQL, JDBC, Maven

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to access and manipulate SQL databases with JDBC. This was my first time introducing other technologies into a Java project in order to access objects and information outside of the Java code itself.
